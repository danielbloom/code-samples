============
Some brief samples of some of my work in **PHP**, **jQuery**, **Backbone.js** and **MySQL**

##PHP and jQuery (plus MVC and grunt)
I have limited ability to post propriatary code, but here is an example from a page in a web app where a user grants or revokes permission for the app to integrate with third party services. The front end uses jQuery and Grunt for task automation and asset management. The back end uses the Zend MVC structure.

##Backbone.js
I worked on a Backbone.js application which acted as a dashboard for call center managers. It asynchronously displays the status of all call center workers who are constantly changing status from Open/Closed/On Call etc. An dummy example can be viewed [here](https://secure.ifbyphone.com/managerpanel.php?key=adc1bbaf0f133450c6eccd4b55a134284cdbfae9&usr_queue_id=31494) though production cases may have hundreds of agents active on the dashboard. The features that I primarily contributed are the ability to sort the agents by call priority, or by name alphabetically or reverse alphabetically. These features are demonstrated in this [tutorial](http://vimeo.com/86921727#t=1m08s). It is important to note that this was a legacy codebase using an older version of Backbone and as such does not 100% comply with current Backbone design practices.
Code can be viewed here.

##Additional jQuery work
Years ago I developed a custom social media analytics platform utilizing the Twitter API and jQuery. It can be accessed at http://jsocialmedia.com - username:password is daniel:daniel - and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPCLizmQlf8) can walk you through the technology. The code itself is a few years old and is not up to my current standards, so I've have not included it in these code samples. If I did today this kind of data and interaction would be better handled using Backbone.js or Angular.
