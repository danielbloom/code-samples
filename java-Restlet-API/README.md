##Java Restlet API
This is an API resource that provides patient data in json form to a React.js front end module. It retrieves data from the db using queryDSL, does a lot of post-processing, before converting the data to the format used by the front end. It uses Junit and Mockito for tests. The endpoint was still in progress when the feature was abandoned.
