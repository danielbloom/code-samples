##jQuery and Twitter API
Years ago I developed a custom social media analytics platform utilizing the Twitter API, PHP and jQuery. It can be accessed at http://jsocialmedia.com - username:password is daniel:daniel - and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPCLizmQlf8) can walk you through the technology. 

The code itself is a few years old and is not up to my current standards, but I've included some the jQuery that handles the show/hide of columns and the retrieval of the shortcut url via the Bitly API. If I did today this kind of data and interaction would be better handled using Backbone.js or AngularJS.
